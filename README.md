# P18452: Real Time Terrain Mapping
In search and rescue operations time is often of the essence and the terrain can end up being wildly different than expected. The ability to image a landscape and use this data to determine the quickest route for operatives driving vehicles in this changing terrain in real-time could save lives in these scenarios. The goal of this project is to lay groundwork on this idea by imaging an area in real-time and using the image to plot route for a small autonomous vehicle.
